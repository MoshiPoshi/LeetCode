#LeetCode Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem has its own folder with a separate file for the solution code.

## About LeetCode

LeetCode is a website that provides a collection of coding challenges that can help programmers enhance their skills. The problems are sorted by difficulty level and cover a wide range of topics, such as algorithms, data structures, and more.

## Structure

Each problem has its own directory, named after the problem's number, containing the following files:

README.md: A description of the problem and my solution approach

solution.[c/py/java]: The implementation of my solution

test_cases.txt: A set of test cases to verify the correctness of the solution
